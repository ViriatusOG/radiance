// halo_gdn_conv_tap.h -- the arithmetic of one gated-delta-net convolution output, shared by the
// standalone conv kernels (halo_gdn_conv_w4_h128_bf16.hip) and the recurrent update that folds the
// decode convolution into its prologue (halo_gdn_recurrent_update_k128_v128_bf16_fp32state.hip).
// A single definition keeps the fold byte-identical to the standalone path: the reciprocal form
// below changes the last bit of some bf16 outputs.
#pragma once

#define HALO_GDN_CONV_W 4        // conv width; the state holds HALO_GDN_CONV_W - 1 taps of history

// The result is rounded to bf16 immediately, so an IEEE-exact divide buys nothing: v_rcp_f32 is
// 1 ULP (~1e-7 relative) against bf16's 2^-8 quantum. The exact form is ~10 dependent instructions
// (v_div_scale, v_rcp, Newton, v_div_fmas, v_div_fixup); this is two. The conv update runs four
// waves on five workgroups, so its time is its instruction count.
