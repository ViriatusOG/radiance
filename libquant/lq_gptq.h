/* lq_gptq.h -- error-feedback quantisation on any grid, against a calibration Hessian.
 *
 * GPTQ picks the codes one column at a time and pushes each column's rounding error into the
 * columns not yet reached, weighted by the inverse Hessian of the layer's real input. Plain
 * rounding treats every column as independent, and a 4-bit grid lacks the levels to absorb that.
 *
 * This file holds the Hessian and the loop, not the grid: codes are chosen on whatever grid the
 * rule names (lq_grid.h), against scales fixed before the loop from the (transformed) weight. This
 * "static groups" form keeps a scale plane a function of the weight alone.
 *
 * The Hessian is the expert's own where the tap recorded one, else the layer's (lq_hess.h,
 * calib_resolve). A layer's pooled Hessian is found from the weight's logical name with the expert
 * index stripped, so its experts share one factor; an expert's own is factored for its one call.
 * The engine's calibration tap writes both (arch/common/rad_arch.h, RADIANCE_CALIB_DIR);
 * docs/MOE-W4.md describes the bootstrap.
