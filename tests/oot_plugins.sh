#
# THE PLUGINS RADIANCE SHIPS, BUILT THE WAY A THIRD PARTY BUILDS THEIRS. The tree's build is
# installed into a prefix; then every plugin directory -- the kernel libraries, the quantisers,
# every architecture, the plugins under plugin/ -- is configured ON ITS OWN against that prefix with find_package(radiance),
# built, and installed into a home of its own. Nothing in the tree's build is reused: what is
# tested is the installed package a stranger would have.
#
# What has to hold afterwards:
#   1. the out-of-tree home holds the same plugins, file for file, as the tree's own build put in
#      its home -- no plugin needs the tree to be built;
#   2. every kernel library declares exactly the vocabulary its in-tree twin declares;
#   3. the search path registers the same plugins, in the same order, with the same declarations
#      (rad-info --plugins), from the out-of-tree home alone;
#   4. the installed rad-kbench replays part of the recorded fixture through the host libraries
#      from that home, and every check passes. The kbench test replays all of it in tree; this
#      replay proves the installed tools serve from the out-of-tree home, so three cheap ops that
#      every host library implements (a norm, the fp8 activation quantiser, a gated activation)
#      are enough;
#   5. with HIP_COMPILER given, the device library the tree built (libr4d) is built out of tree
#      too, for HIP_TARGETS and at the tree's RAD_HIP_VOPD_REPEATABLE (VOPD_REPEATABLE, default
#      OFF; on LLVM 24 it decides whether VOPD pairs, so it changes the code), and compiles to the
#      tree's device code. A replay of a device library needs a card, and this test must not touch
#      one a server is using; the same instructions mean the tree's own GPU suite (ctest -L gpu)
#      has already checked what the out-of-tree build produced.
