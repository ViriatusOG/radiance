/* diag.h -- the startup report: what was configured, what it runs on, and what looks wrong.
 *
 * One block at the end of startup, instead of decisions scattered through the log (defaults are
 * never logged at all): every option with its value and source, the machine as the kernel
 * describes it, and findings that cost speed or correctness, each with a fix.
 *
 * Each part is built from data, not a list kept beside the code:
 *   Configuration  every row of the option table (core/config.cpp); a value startup resolved
 *                  carries its reason (Decision).
 *   Hardware       read from /proc and /sys under a root, so tests can supply a tree and a
 *                  FROM-scratch container (no shell, lspci or rocm-smi) reads the same files.
 *   Findings       small functions over the two above (checks.cpp), testable without a card.
 *
 * A field that could not be read is reported as unknown, never omitted.
