/* media.h -- image, video and audio decoding, and picture encoding (spec §11).
 *
 * One decoder for everything: libavformat/libavcodec. An image is a one-frame stream, so PNG,
 * JPEG, WebP, GIF, BMP and TIFF take the same demuxer probe, decode loop and colour conversion
 * (libswscale) as a video. In a build without the libraries every call returns
 * RAD_E_UNSUPPORTED with the reason, and the server refuses the media part by name.
 *
 * Bytes come from the request only (`data:` URLs). Nothing here opens a file or a network
 * stream: the demuxer reads a memory buffer through its own I/O context, and the protocol
 * whitelist is empty.
 *
 * A Frame is packed 8-bit RGB, row-major, no padding. Alpha is dropped, not composited, as the
 * reference processor's PIL convert("RGB") does, so a transparent PNG reaches the encoder with
 * the colours under its alpha.
