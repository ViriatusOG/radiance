/* rad_block_ple.h -- Qwen4-Exp's Per-Layer Embedding, declared and issued.
 *
 * ============================== WHAT IT IS ==============================
 *
 * One layer has a second embedding table addressed by a hash of the last three tokens.
 * Qwen3.8-Flash-Next's is 320,001,536 rows of 160 (51 of the checkpoint's 125 billion
 * parameters), read sixteen rows per token and mixed into the residual stream by a dot product
 * against the stream:
 *
 *   ids  = ngram_ids(tokens)                     [T, 16]   a hash of the last 3 ids, per head
 *   e    = embed_lookup_q(ids, table, scale)     [T, 2560]  16 x 160, flattened
 *   k    = key_proj(e)    [T, hc*n]              v = value_proj(e)    [T, n]
 *   gv,
 *   gvn  = ple_gate(k, h, v, ...)                the dot, the signed sqrt, the broadcast
 *   out  = ple_conv(gvn, resid = gv, ...)        dilated depthwise conv, silu, and the add
 *   h   += out
 *
 * This runs before the attention hyper-connection reads the stream, so `h` is the wide, un-normed
 * residual.
 *
 * ============================== THE TABLE ==============================
 *
 * The 51.2 GB table cannot be staged onto a card, so `embed_lookup_q` reads it where
 * --ngram-placement put it: a host gather over the container's mmap or a locked RAM copy
 * (libavx/avx_ngram.cpp), a device kernel reading a pinned copy over the link, or a card's own
 * copy. The result reaches the card through the host arena, 5 KB per token at decode. Hence:
 *
 *   The table is a weight operand: the planner places an op on the host only when all its weight
 *   operands are Site::Host, judged from the table's placement.
 *
 *   `ids` and `e` are host-domain buffers, written and read by the host gather; a device gather
 *   accesses them over the link. Everything downstream of `e` is device work.
 *
 *   It is 128 checkpoint tensors, mapped in pieces by map_concat_shards(); the order is the
 *   concatenation, and a permuted table silently looks up wrong rows.
 *
 * ============================== THE TWO ROLLING WINDOWS ==============================
 *
 * The n-gram hash needs the two committed ids before the step, and the convolution nine timesteps
 * of its input. Both are RAD_KV_CONV windows read at `num_accepted - 1`. The token window's cold
 * value is EOS, the convolution's zero (zero is a real token id); `has_init` marks cold slots.
 *
 * What a step leaves in the window depends on the step, signalled by whether `num_accepted` is
 * passed (libref/ref_ple.cpp). A decode row may have drafts rejected, so its window uses
 * gdn_conv_update's shifted layout, where the next read offset selects the history ending at the
 * last kept token. A prefill chunk commits everything and leaves its tail at offset zero, read by
 * the next step's `num_accepted` of 1. One layout cannot serve both, so step() issues both ops
 * once per half of the batch, as rad_block_gdn_fp8.h does.

     * The rest is 63 MiB per rank (key_proj 50, value_proj 12.5, three norm gains, a conv weight).
     * Column-sharding the projections would shard `gv` and `gvn` across the hyper-connection
     * streams and need an all-gather per step to save 31 MiB per card. Every rank adds the same
     * `out` into an identical copy of the stream, so the result stays bit-identical across ranks.
     *
     * The duplicated gather is `heads` rows per token: 16 at decode, 32768 at a 2048-token chunk,
     * about 70 ms per rank through the mapping (7.6% of a prefill step). That cost is page-table
     * population, not I/O: a prefill's distinct rows land about one per 4 KiB page (of 25), so the
     * mapping pays a fault per row. At decode half of each step's rows are new and the page cache
     * makes the waiting thread start each read. So the kernel keeps its own row cache and reads
     * misses straight from the file (libavx/avx_ngram.cpp). Ranks share that cache: each claims
     * and reads the misses it reaches first and waits only for rows another rank has claimed, so
     * each miss is read once without a cross-rank barrier.
